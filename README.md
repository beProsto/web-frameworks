## Checking different Web Frameworks out :D

Making the same exact project in a couple different web frameworks to see which one i like best.

I'm rooting for svelte on this one as it seems to follow my actual ideas the most, but we'll see. ^^

Web Frameworks:
- Native/HTML+CSS+JS
- Svelte
- React
- Alpine

"Why 3 so obscure ones":
Because they're different. Looking all around for other better frameworks (to which i include libraries, as per react and alpine being in the project) you quickly realise that they're mostly derivitive of react. I wanted to check out things that'd actually differ in a way that matters when actually developing, so developer experience (mostly).

Project overview:
- Make a 3 page app, showing a:
  1. Welcome back screen, showing your "username".
